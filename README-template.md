Struggling to make things responsive so I have been taking Kevin Powell's responsive course and decided to follow him along in his video about this challenge; which has been very helpful in understanding how responsive websites work, heigh and width properties, and  rem and em. Also learned some new html tags and attributes which should be very helpful in feature projects.
